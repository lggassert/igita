igita - Interative Git Application
==================================

Commands
--------

igita easily responds to any valid git command. Just type:

        >> <command>

when you'd normally type (on a regular shell):

        >> git <command>

It can also respond to any system call:

        >> shell <system call>

or:

        >> ! <system call>


For convenience, igita implements some other calls:

*       _ls_ - the same as 'git status'
*       _cd_ - the same as 'git checkout'
*       _quit_ **or** _q_ - exits igita
*       _git_ - for when you forget you're using igita
